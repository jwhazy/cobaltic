# Cobaltic

...was easiest way to download Fortnite from Epic's servers. However, Epic has killed off downloading manifests. There are other alternatives available however they aren't suitable or compatiable with Cobaltic. 

**Cobaltic will no longer work and its development has come to an end. Thank you to everyone who supported and downloaded the project.**
